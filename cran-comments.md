## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Addressed the following comment: "It seems like you have too many spaces in
  your description field. Probably because linebreaks count as spaces too. 
  Please remove unecassary ones." I removed linebreaks in the description field.
  
* Addressed the following comment: "Please write TRUE and FALSE instead of T 
  and F. Please don't use "T" or "F" as vector names." I replaced all instances
  of T and F with TRUE and FALSE.
